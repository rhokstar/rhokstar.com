If you have a Overheating Nomad, I did some research on this. The solution to prevent over heating is to:  
1. upgrade the stock power plant to a "Charger" or better, not the cooler 
2. you can remove one shield 

Hopefully the devs fix this in time for the next free flight week (most likely Invictus) because this ship is in the "Starter Pack" category and therefore new players may experience this bug. In my opinion, this is not fair for new players to encounter this bug on a ship they bought to get into the game. I acknowledge this game is an alpha and that there are many bugs (naturally) however when it comes to any starter ship, a bug this severe should not exist.  

Long story short, I was helping a friend get into SC. The nomad seemed like a good choice. A day later he got overheating problems on stock components. I felt guilty for recommending the ship (I didn't know about the bug) and sought to find solutions and even gave him aUEC to buy grade A components. This bug is reported on issue council with over 116 contributions from 10 reports. I conducted 24 tests to find solutions (details in the video).
