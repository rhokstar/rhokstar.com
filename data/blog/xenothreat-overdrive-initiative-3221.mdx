I was not able to finish all 6 stages in the EPTU build.  

This guide was created from the last EPTU 3.22.1 patch. The LIVE 3.22.1 patch could change parts of the missions. I wanted to get this guide to out ASAP to reduce the amount of confusion that can occur because it has 6 stages with over 16 missions!
