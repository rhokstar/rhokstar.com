## Hello

Ever since the days of COVID and work from home, my interests in Star Citizen have grown even further. I wanted to document my experiences for many reasons such as providing CIG developer feedback and information detailed-oriented players. Perhaps one day, we will look back at these experiences many years from now (and with a finished game) and have a good laugh!
