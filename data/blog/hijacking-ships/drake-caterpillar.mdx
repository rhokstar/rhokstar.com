🎮 What's Inside:
Step-by-Step Guide:
1) Equip you ship with multiple distortion guns. Also, pick a ship that can tank a lot of damage if you're doing this solo.
2) Choose a VHRT or ERT bounty hunter mission that are either on a moon or on planet. These missions most likely have ships that have AI controlled turrets. If you attempt to hijack a ship in space, the ship my not come to a full stop.
3) Disable the ship you want to steal / pirate / hijack. Make sure the ship is right-side up or you'll have to devise a method to enter the ship.
4) Breach the ship by shooting at the entrance. Some ships take longer to breach and also depends on your weapon.
5) Kill the pilot but spare the lives of your AI turret gunners.
